# IAM & PAM Technical Report

## Executive Summary

Identity is the new perimeter. Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Privileged Access Management (PAM) are foundational controls for securing modern hybrid, cloud-first enterprises. IAM manages who can access what, when, and how; PAM protects, monitors, and controls accounts that have elevated privileges and can cause outsized damage if compromised.

Adopting IAM + PAM reduces risk from credential theft, lateral movement, insider misuse, and supply-chain compromises, while enabling compliance, auditability, and operational efficiency. Leading solutions in 2025 emphasise passwordless authentication (FIDO2/WebAuthn), adaptive risk-based access, identity governance, and just-in-time privileged access

## 1. Why IAM and PAM are Used

### 1.1 Business & Security Drivers
- **Protect against credential-based attacks:** Compromised credentials are the leading vector for breaches; IAM centralises authn/authz and enforces MFA and risk controls.
- **Limit blast radius of breaches:** Principle of least privilege across identities and machines prevents attackers from easily escalating access.
- **Compliance & audit readiness:** IAM/IAM-Governance (IGA) automates access reviews, attestation, and separation-of-duty policies required by regulations.
- **Operational efficiency:** SSO reduces password resets and friction; automated provisioning speeds onboarding/offboarding.
- **Secure cloud & hybrid work:** Centralised identity is essential for consistent access controls across SaaS, IaaS, and on-prem systems.

### 1.2 Specific Problems Solved
- Eliminates unmanaged, shared admin accounts. (PAM)
- Prevents standing high-privilege access through Just-In-Time (JIT) access and session brokering. (PAM)
- Provides a single source of truth for user lifecycle and entitlements (IGA).
- Enables contextual adaptive access (device health, location, risk score).

## 2. Core Concepts & Components

### 2.1 IAM Components
- **Identity Provider (IdP):** Authenticates users and issues tokens (examples: Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, Ping Identity). 
- **Access Management / SSO:** Centralised authentication to apps via SAML/OAuth/OIDC.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) & Passwordless:** FIDO2/WebAuthn, device-based auth, mobile authenticators. Passwordless reduces phishing risk. 
- **Identity Governance and Administration (IGA):** Access reviews, entitlements, role mining (SailPoint, Saviynt). 
- **Privileged Identity Lifecycle:** Tracking service accounts, machine identities, API keys.

### 2.2 PAM Components
- **Credential Vault / Password Vaulting:** Secure secret storage with rotation.
- **Session Management & Monitoring:** Broker privileged sessions, record keystrokes and commands.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) / Just-Enough-Access (JEA):** Temporary elevation for tasks.
- **Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM):** Control local admin rights and application elevation.
- **Secrets Management:** Vaults for application/service secrets (HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault).

---

## 3. Modern Capabilities & Trends (2025)

- **Passwordless & FIDO2 adoption:** Enterprises increasingly adopt FIDO2/WebAuthn for high-assurance, phishing-resistant authentication. Microsoft Entra and others have first-class support. 
- **AI-driven adaptive access:** Risk scoring using behavioural signals and device telemetry to allow conditional access in real time. 
- **Convergence of IGA + PAM:** Unified platforms tie governance (who should have access) to runtime privileged controls.
- **Secrets-as-code for DevOps:** Integration of PAM/secrets management into CI/CD pipelines (HashiCorp Vault, strongdm, Keeper, CyberArk Conjur).
- **Cloud-native identity & workload identity:** Managed identity services (Azure Managed Identities, AWS IAM Roles for Service Accounts) reduce static credentials in cloud workloads.

## 4. Business Case: Why Management Should Invest

### 4.1 Risk Reduction & ROI
- **Quantifiable risk reduction:** Reduces the likelihood of high-severity breaches from credential compromise. Estimate: Preventing a single breach can save millions in incident response, legal, and reputational damage.
- **Operational savings:** SSO + automated provisioning reduces helpdesk password resets (large orgs save thousands of hours annually).
- **Compliance efficiency:** Automated evidence for audits reduces audit prep time and penalties for non-compliance.

### 4.2 Strategic Benefits
- Foundation for Zero Trust architecture: Identity-centric controls are required for Zero Trust.
- Supports hybrid and remote work securely, enabling business agility.
- Improves developer velocity by securing secrets and integrating into pipelines.

### 4.3 Risk of Not Acting
- Continued exposure to lateral movement, ransomware, and supply-chain attacks.
- Regulatory and insurance consequences if identity controls are lacking.

## 5. High-Level Architecture & Logic (How IAM + PAM Work Together)

1. **Authentication & session issuance:** User authenticates via IdP (SSO) with MFA.
2. **Access decision:** Access Management evaluates policy (role, context, device health, risk score).
3. **Privileged access request:** If a user needs an admin task, they request it via PAM portal/ticket integration.
4. **JIT elevation & session brokering:** PAM grants temporary credentials and brokers session; records session activity.
5. **Governance & audit:** IGA triggers access reviews and records entitlement changes; PAM reports session logs for audit.

## 6. Implementation Roadmap (12–24 weeks typical)

**Phase 0: Discovery (2–4 weeks)**
- Inventory identities, applications (SBOM-like), privileged accounts, and existing auth flows.
- Stakeholder alignment: HR, IT, Security, DevOps.

**Phase 1: Core IAM (4–8 weeks)**
- Deploy IdP (or consolidate to Entra/Okta/Ping). Enable SSO for high-value apps.
- Roll out MFA and pilot passwordless for a controlled user group. 

**Phase 2: IGA & Provisioning (4–8 weeks)**
- Implement IGA workflows: roles, access request/approval, access reviews (SailPoint/Saviynt recommended for enterprise IGA). 

**Phase 3: PAM & Secrets (4–12 weeks)**
- Install PAM vault, onboard critical admin accounts, enforce password rotation, enable session recording (CyberArk, Delinea, BeyondTrust, StrongDM, KeeperPAM examples). 
- Integrate secrets management into CI/CD (HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider vaults).

**Phase 4: Harden & Optimize (ongoing)**
- Expand SSO, enable JIT for more roles, tune adaptive policies.
- KPIs: reduction in helpdesk tickets, MFA adoption rate, number of high-privileged accounts removed/rotated.

## 8. Metrics, KPIs & Reporting to Management

Track as part of quarterly security KPIs:
- **MFA adoption rate** (target >95% for privileged users).
- **Percentage of apps behind SSO** (target 80–95% for enterprise SaaS estate).
- **Number of privileged accounts eliminated/moved to JIT** (show reduction in standing privileges).
- **Mean time to revoke access** after role change/termination.
- **Number of password resets reduced** (helpdesk cost savings).
- **Audit readiness:** time to produce access review evidence (target: days -> minutes).

Translate these into potential $$$ savings by estimating time saved, reduction in breach probability, and avoided regulatory fines.

## 9. Risks, Challenges & Mitigations

- **Complexity & integration effort:** Multiple apps and legacy systems require custom connectors. *Mitigation:* phased rollout, prioritise high-risk apps.
- **User friction & adoption:** Users resist new steps. *Mitigation:* SSO + passwordless to reduce friction, pilots and training.
- **Single point of failure:** IdP outage risk. *Mitigation:* high availability, redundant IdP setups, local break-glass procedures.
- **Cost:** Licensing and operational overhead. *Mitigation:* start with scope-limited pilots and measure ROI.

## 10. Budgetary & Resourcing Considerations (High Level)

Estimate ranges (very approximate):
- **Small org (≤500 users):** $20k–$120k initial (licenses + implementation).
- **Mid-market (500–5k users):** $100k–$500k initial, yearly licenses thereafter.
- **Enterprise (5k+):** $500k+ initial; depends on IGA, PAM breadth, custom integrations, and managed services.

Costs include software licenses (IdP, IGA, PAM), as well as professional services for integration, training, and operational staff (1–2 FTEs initially for identity operations in mid-to-large organisations).

---

## 11. Next Steps & Recommended Pilot Plan

1. **Executive sponsor & steering committee:** Assign CISO/Head IT as sponsor, include HR, Legal, DevOps.
2. **Discovery workshop (2 weeks):** Inventory apps, privileged accounts, and define success metrics.
3. **Pilot:** Deploy IdP + SSO + MFA to a single business unit; onboard critical privileged accounts into PAM vault and enable session recording.
4. **Evaluate & expand:** Use metrics to build ROI story and plan broader rollout (12–24 weeks).

---

## 12. Appendix — Sample Policy Snippets

**Privileged Access Policy (short):**
- No permanent shared admin passwords.
- All privileged sessions must be initiated via PAM and recorded.
- JIT access for administrative tasks; approvals recorded and time-limited.
