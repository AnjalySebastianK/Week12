# LAN, MAN, and WAN â€“ Detailed Study

## Introduction  
Networking enables communication and resource sharing between devices. Based on **geographical scope**, networks are categorized as:  
- **Local Area Network (LAN)** â€“ Small area (home, office, campus).  
- **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)** â€“ City-wide coverage.  
- **Wide Area Network (WAN)** â€“ Global coverage (Internet).  

Each has unique features, technologies, advantages, and use cases.

## 1. Local Area Network (LAN)

### Definition  
A **LAN** is a network restricted to a **small area** like a home, office, or campus.

### Features  
- **Coverage:** Few meters to a few kilometres.  
- **Ownership:** Private.  
- **Speed:** 100 Mbps â€“ 10+ Gbps.  
- **Topology:** Star (most common), bus, ring, mesh.  
- **Cost:** Low.  

### Components  
- End devices: PCs, laptops, servers, printers.  
- Devices: Switches, routers, hubs, Wi-Fi access points.  
- Media: Ethernet cables (Cat5e, Cat6), Wi-Fi.  
- Protocols: Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11).  

### Advantages  
- High speed and reliability.  
- Cost-effective.  
- Easy to manage in small setups.  

### Disadvantages  
- Limited to small areas.  
- Vulnerable to security threats if not configured properly.  

### Examples  
- Home Wi-Fi.  
- University campus intranet.  
- Small company network.

## 2. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

### Definition  
A **MAN** spans a **city or metropolitan region**, interconnecting multiple LANs.

### Features  
- **Coverage:** 5 to 50 km.  
- **Ownership:** ISP, government, or private companies.  
- **Speed:** 10 Mbps â€“ several Gbps.  
- **Topology:** Ring topology is common.  
- **Cost:** Higher than LAN.  

### Components  
- Backbone: Fibre optics, leased lines, wireless (WiMAX).  
- Devices: Routers, modems, optical switches.  
- Technologies: Metro Ethernet, ATM, SONET/SDH.  

### Advantages  
- Connects multiple LANs.  
- High-speed backbone for cities.  
- More secure than WAN.  

### Disadvantages  
- Expensive setup.  
- Complex management.  
- Limited scalability beyond a city.  

### Examples  
- City-wide broadband.  
- Inter-campus university network.  
- Cable TV distribution.

## 3. Wide Area Network (WAN)

### Definition  
A **WAN** covers **large areas across countries or continents**, connecting multiple LANs and MANs.

### Features  
- **Coverage:** Hundreds to thousands of kilometres.  
- **Ownership:** Shared by ISPs, telecoms, governments.  
- **Speed:** 1 Mbps â€“ 100+ Gbps.  
- **Topology:** Mesh or hybrid.  
- **Cost:** Very high.  

### Components  
- Media: Submarine cables, satellites, fiber optics, 4G/5G.  
- Technologies: MPLS, Frame Relay, SD-WAN, VPN.  
- Devices: Core routers, firewalls, long-haul switches.  

### Advantages  
- Global communication.  
- Enables Internet and cloud services.  
- Connects multinational businesses.  

### Disadvantages  
- High latency in some cases.  
- Expensive infrastructure.  
- Greater security risks.  

### Examples  
- The Internet (largest WAN).  
- Corporate WANs across branches.  
- Banking networks (SWIFT).
