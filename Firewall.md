# Firewall 
**Traditional Firewalls vs. Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW) vs. Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**  

---

## Introduction  

Firewalls are **security devices or software** that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.  
They act as the **first line of defence** in network security by separating trusted internal networks from untrusted external ones (like the Internet).  

Over time, firewalls have evolved:  

1. **Traditional Firewalls** – Focus on **basic packet filtering** (IP, port, protocol).  
2. **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)** – Add **application awareness, intrusion prevention, SSL inspection**.  
3. **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)** – Specialize in **protecting web applications** from application-layer attacks.

## 1. Traditional Firewalls  

### Definition  
A **traditional firewall** is the earliest type of firewall that enforces access control by **filtering packets** based on **IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols**.  

### History  
- **1980s** – First generation: **Packet-filtering firewalls** (simple header checks).  
- **1990s** – Second generation: **Stateful inspection firewalls** (track sessions, not just packets).  

### Working Mechanism  
- Operates at **Network Layer (L3)** and **Transport Layer (L4)** of the OSI model.  
- Uses **rules (ACLs)** like:  
  - Allow traffic from IP `192.168.1.10` to port `80`.  
  - Deny traffic from IP `10.0.0.5`.  
- Can allow/deny traffic **per packet** or **per session** (in stateful firewalls).  

### Features  
- IP-based filtering.  
- Port-based filtering (e.g., allow TCP/443, block UDP/23).  
- Protocol control (TCP, UDP, ICMP).  
- Simple rule-based access control.  

### Advantages  
- Low cost, easy to implement.  
- Fast and efficient (low overhead).  
- Effective for **basic perimeter defense**.  

### Disadvantages  
- Cannot **inspect payloads** (only headers).  
- Cannot detect **application-layer attacks** (SQL injection, XSS).  
- Limited handling of **encrypted traffic** (SSL/TLS).  
- No built-in **intrusion prevention**.  

### Use Cases  
- Small businesses and home networks.  
- Basic filtering in routers.  
- Enforcing simple network segmentation.

## 2. Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)  

### Definition  
An **NGFW** is an advanced firewall that integrates **traditional firewall functions** with **intrusion prevention, deep packet inspection (DPI), application control, and threat intelligence**.  

### History  
- Introduced in **mid-2000s** to counter evolving threats (malware, zero-day attacks, encrypted traffic).  
- Became popular as businesses moved to **cloud, BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), and SaaS** environments.  

### Working Mechanism  
- Operates across **multiple OSI layers (L3–L7)**.  
- Performs:  
  - **Packet filtering** (like traditional firewalls).  
  - **Deep Packet Inspection** – inspects packet payloads for malicious content.  
  - **Application awareness** – identifies applications (e.g., Facebook, WhatsApp, Dropbox).  
  - **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** – detects and blocks attacks using signatures and anomaly detection.  
  - **SSL/TLS Inspection** – decrypts encrypted traffic for inspection.  
  - **User identity integration** – applies rules based on usernames/roles, not just IP addresses.  

### Features  
- Traditional firewall + advanced security features.  
- DPI, IPS, anti-malware protection.  
- Threat intelligence integration.  
- Application-level policies (block YouTube but allow Teams).  
- Cloud and virtualisation support.  

### Advantages  
- Protects against **modern threats** (malware, ransomware, APTs, zero-days).  
- Offers **granular control** at the user and application level.  
- Enforces **security policies across hybrid networks** (on-prem + cloud).  

### Disadvantages  
- Expensive compared to traditional firewalls.  
- Complex to configure and maintain.  
- **Performance overhead** (DPI and SSL inspection may slow down traffic).  

### Use Cases  
- Enterprises with multiple branch offices.  
- Cloud security and hybrid IT environments.  
- Organizations requiring **application-level visibility** and compliance.

## 3. Web Application Firewalls (WAF)  

### Definition  
A **WAF** is a specialised firewall that **protects web applications** by filtering and monitoring **HTTP/HTTPS traffic**.  
It defends against **application-layer attacks**.  

### History  
- Gained importance in the **early 2000s** as **web-based attacks** (SQL injection, XSS) became common.  
- Now widely adopted due to **e-commerce, APIs, and SaaS applications**.  

### Working Mechanism  
- Operates at the **Application Layer (L7)** of the OSI model.  
- Analyzes **HTTP requests and responses**.  
- Detects and blocks malicious patterns:  
  - Malicious input in URL/query strings.  
  - Abnormal request headers.  
  - Bot traffic or brute-force attempts.  

### Features  
- Protects against **OWASP Top 10 attacks**:  
  - SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, File Inclusion, etc.  
- Can handle **encrypted HTTPS traffic**.  
- Offers **bot mitigation and DDoS protection**.  
- Deployments:  
  - **Cloud WAF** (AWS WAF, Cloudflare, Azure).  
  - **On-prem WAF** (F5 BIG-IP, Imperva).  

### Advantages  
- Specialized protection for **web apps and APIs**.  
- Provides **virtual patching** before code fixes are applied.  
- Easy deployment as a cloud service (low admin overhead).  

### Disadvantages  
- Only protects **web applications**, not full networks.  
- High risk of **false positives** if rules are too strict.  
- Needs **constant tuning** for dynamic applications.  

### Use Cases  
- E-commerce websites.  
- Banking & financial applications.  
- API-driven SaaS services.
