# Recent Malware Attacks (2025)
---

## 1. Black Basta Reborn Campaign (June 2025)
- **Type:** Ransomware using Microsoft Teams phishing  
- **How it worked:** Attackers sent fake IT support alerts via Microsoft Teams. Victims installed remote access tools like AnyDesk, allowing Python-based malware to steal files and control systems.  
- **Analogy:** Like calling “tech support” who installs spyware instead of fixing problems.  
- **Impact:** U.S. healthcare and corporate networks compromised; sensitive records stolen and encrypted.  
- **Lesson:** Always verify internal messages—even inside trusted apps. Use multi-factor authentication and monitor unusual Teams activity.

## 2. Chaos Ransomware Attack on Optima (May 2025)
- **Type:** Double extortion ransomware  
- **How it worked:** Attackers encrypted servers and exfiltrated 69GB of private tax records. They demanded ransom and later leaked data on dark web forums.  
- **Analogy:** Like burglars stealing your documents and locking your office until you pay.  
- **Impact:** Loss of sensitive tax information; operations halted for days.  
- **Lesson:** Maintain off-site encrypted backups and regularly test ransomware restoration drills.

## 3. Salt Typhoon Telecom Attack (2025)
- **Type:** Nation-state advanced persistent threat (APT)  
- **How it worked:** The Chinese-linked group “Salt Typhoon” exploited network software vulnerabilities, planting persistent backdoors in telecom core systems.  
- **Analogy:** Like placing undetectable wiretaps in phone towers.  
- **Impact:** Compromised nine major telecoms; possible eavesdropping on network traffic.  
- **Lesson:** Apply Zero Trust to critical infrastructure; continuously monitor privileged access and network traffic anomalies.

## 4. Shai-Hulud Supply Chain Attack (September 2025)
- **Type:** Open-source dependency compromise  
- **How it worked:** Attackers planted malicious code in a widely used package dependency. Thousands of developers unknowingly downloaded infected versions.  
- **Analogy:** Like poisoning the city’s water at its main source.  
- **Impact:** Hundreds of projects shipped malware-infested software builds.  
- **Lesson:** Verify open-source dependencies using digital signatures, SBOM tracking, and checksum validation.

## 5. Sensata Ransomware Breach (2025)
- **Type:** Targeted ransomware with staged encryption  
- **How it worked:** Threat actors stayed inside the network for over a week before triggering encryption, while quietly stealing employee data.  
- **Analogy:** Like burglars studying your house before the robbery.  
- **Impact:** Employee payroll and insurance data stolen; encryption disrupted industrial operations.  
- **Lesson:** Implement behaviour-based detection and lateral movement monitoring.

## 6. Akira Ransomware Surge (Early 2025)
- **Type:** AI‑generated ransomware variants  
- **How it worked:** The Akira group used AI automation to create new strains that bypassed antivirus detection by mutating their signature patterns.  
- **Analogy:** Like a thief who changes disguises faster than cameras can update.  
- **Impact:** Over 70 global incidents, mainly targeting manufacturing and retail.  
- **Lesson:** Use behavioural analysis tools and adaptive threat intelligence to detect evolving attack techniques.

## 7. Education Sector QR‑Phishing Attacks (2025)
- **Type:** QR‑code‑based ransomware and data breaches  
- **How it worked:** Attackers used fake QR codes in emails to lure school staff into entering credentials, which led to ransomware installation.  
- **Analogy:** Like scanning a fake parking code that opens your phone to a hacker.  
- **Impact:** Over 560 educational institutions worldwide faced data leaks and system lockouts.  
- **Lesson:** Conduct staff awareness training on QR phishing; isolate and patch legacy systems.
