# OSINT: Open-Source Intelligence 

## What is OSINT?

**OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)** is the practice of collecting and analysing information from publicly available sources. These sources can include:

- **Social Media:** Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.
- **Public Records:** WHOIS, domain registries, government databases.
- **News & Publications:** Press releases, blogs, articles.
- **Internet Services:** Websites, cloud services, APIs.

**Purpose:** OSINT is used by cybersecurity professionals, investigators, journalists, and law enforcement to gather intelligence in a **legal and ethical manner**.  
> ⚠️ Key Principle: OSINT involves publicly available and only ** information**—never bypass passwords, hacking protections, or access controls without explicit permission.

## OSINT Methodologies

OSINT can be divided into two main approaches:

### 1. Passive Collection
Passive collection means **observing without interacting** with the target.  

**Examples:**

| Task | Tool / Method |
|------|---------------|
| Domain info | `whois example.com`, `dig example.com` |
| Subdomain enumeration | Certificate Transparency (crt.sh), DNS history |
| Social media research | Twitter searches, LinkedIn profiles |
| Search engines | Google, Bing, using advanced operators |

**Advantages:**  
- Low risk of detection  
- Safe legally and ethically  
- Often sufficient to map the target’s footprint  

### 2. Active Collection
Active collection involves **interacting directly** with the target. It may be legal if in scope, but can be detectable.  

**Examples:**

| Task | Tool / Method |
|------|---------------|
| Port scanning | Nmap, Masscan |
| Banner grabbing | Netcat, Shodan (passive + active) |
| Service probing | Attempting to connect to exposed services |

**Note:** Always get **explicit permission** for active tasks. Unauthorised scanning or probing can be illegal.

## Key OSINT Tools & How They Work

### 1. Maltego
Maltego is a **graphical link analysis and data visualisation tool**.

**How it works:**

1. Start with an entity (like a domain, IP, or email).
2. Run **transforms** to gather related entities.
3. Expand entities recursively to build a **graph of relationships**.

**Practical Example:**

- Start with `sjcetpalai.ac.in`
- Run `Domain → To DNS Names` → discovers subdomains
- Run `Domain → To IPs` → maps which servers host these subdomains
- Run `IP → To Reverse DNS / To Domains on same IP` → finds co-hosted domains

**Purpose:**  
- Identifies relationships between domains, subdomains, IPs, and emails  
- Reveals non-obvious infrastructure connections

### 2. Google Dorks
Google Dorks are **advanced search queries** designed to find sensitive or hidden data.

**Common Operators:**

| Operator | Example | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `site:` | `site:sjcetpalai.ac.in` | Search within a specific domain |
| `filetype:` | `filetype:pdf` | Find files of a specific type |
| `intitle:` | `intitle:"index of"` | Detect directory listings |
| `inurl:` | `inurl:admin` | Locate login portals |

**Examples of High-Value Dorks:**

```text
site:sjcetpalai.ac.in filetype:pdf
site:sjcetpalai.ac.in intext:"password"
```

**Caution:**  
- Never download files or access credentials unless authorised  
- Use cached versions or the Wayback Machine to reference exposures safely

### 3. OSINT Framework
The **OSINT Framework** is a curated map of thousands of OSINT tools organised by category.  

**How to use:**

1. Visit [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/)
2. Select a category (e.g., "Username")
3. Explore linked tools (e.g., Check multiple social networks for a username)
4. Repeat for domains, IPs, emails, or people

**Purpose:**  
- Quick reference for analysts  
- Discover tools for passive reconnaissance without trial-and-error searching

---

### 4. Shodan
Shodan is the "**search engine for Internet-connected devices**".

**How it works:**

- Scans internet-connected devices for open ports and banners
- Indexes server types, versions, protocols, and metadata

**Purpose:**  
- Discover exposed servers, IoT devices, and services  
- Detect misconfigurations or outdated software  

**Tip:** Free accounts have limited results; paid accounts allow full API access.

## Putting It All Together

**Step-by-step OSINT workflow:**

1. **Define scope**: Domain names, people, organizations
2. **Passive collection**: WHOIS, DNS, CT logs, archives
3. **Search engine and code search**: Google Dorks, GitHub
4. **Internet-facing devices**: Shodan, Censys (passive)
5. **Visual mapping**: Maltego graphs for relationships
6. **Document findings**: Include screenshots, URLs, and timestamps

---

## Practical Tips

- **Respect privacy & law:** Only gather publicly available data or have authorisation
- **Record everything:** Maintain logs, screenshots, and query lists
- **Avoid exploitation:** The goal is observation, not hacking
- **Check for false positives:** Not every exposed file or IP is exploitable
